					<h3 style="text-align:left">Form Experience Critique</h3>
                    <p>1. Form fields' look and feel are dated. </p>
                    <p>2. There is too much space in between each field and also the CTA. </p>
                    <p>3. The steps above the form should be evenly spaced out to the end of the progress bar. It will help decrease the busy look in that section on mobile. <br></p>

					<h3>UI/UX Suggestions</h3>
                    <p>1. There is a form field trend going on with the top visited sites. Netflix.com, Reddit.com and Google.com all follow a similar form field experience where form field labels are inside the input fields by default and become smaller inside the field when it is focused/clicked on and filled. In experience, following web trends has tested well for the most part.</p>
